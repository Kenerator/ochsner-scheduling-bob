# Switch duplicate-fixture ZIP and revoke prior authority

Purpose: Show that changing the exact ZIP selects a different fixture and clears dependent private state. Role: patient reviewer.
Scope: US2 / FR-004 / tests/test_transition_acceptance.py. Mode: normal model-first launch with an explicit offline
control path; the documented local controls need no model call.
Limits: synthetic fixtures only; no production authentication, real staff contact
or clinical care. Two fixtures share phone/DOB; ZIP correction never transfers a prior proposal, consent or private result.

## Step 0 — Install and set up

From the repository root in your dedicated local checkout:

```sh
python3.11 --version
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
.venv/bin/python -m pip check
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py --doctor
```

Verify Python 3.11+ before creating the environment. If `python3.11` is absent,
use `python3.12 --version` and `python3.12 -m venv .venv` after verifying that
explicit executable is compatible; the remaining commands stay the same.
The doctor reads no key, starts no service and makes no model request. Use
[getting started](../getting-started.md) for the trusted exact-note helper and
current application runtime policy; do not paste a key into BOB or these notes.
Resolve a failed install, dependency check or doctor before proceeding.

## Step 1 — Launch

Normal model-first launch:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py
```

Open the printed local URL. Startup/readiness is not model qualification.
For an explicit no-call walkthrough alternative, use the following ONLY IF both
ports are free:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py --offline --ui-port 29580 --transport-port 29581
```

A port conflict is not permission to stop another process. Do not reuse an
existing process for this trial; arrange another free pair or defer launch.
Ctrl-C in your launch terminal stops only this launch's owned children. All
supplied W2 capture evidence is offline or explicitly historical, with no new
genuine model qualification.

## Arrange the workspace

Keep this rendered Markdown on the left and BOB on the right. In Chrome, open
the tab context menu and choose **New split view**, then **Add tab** for the
other page; use **Swap sides** if needed. Follow the
[official Chrome Split View instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/16971124?hl=en).
If unavailable, arrange two windows side by side; no extension or experimental
flags are required. Open figures full size if labels are small; each action
below also has a text equivalent.

## Synthetic sample data

1. Private Synthetic phone: `555-0130`.
2. Private Date of birth: `1978-09-22`.
3. Initial private ZIP discriminator: `70115`; replacement private ZIP: `70005`.
4. Public Specialty: Primary care (`primary_care`); Location: Downtown (`downtown`); dates blank.

Identity values belong only in private controls. Keep names, phone, DOB and ZIP
out of Public scheduling request; its examples below contain public intent only.

## Step 2 — Start a dedicated patient session
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":2,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["toolbar-composite"],"control_ids":["start-independent-patient"]} -->

Select **Start independent patient** (`start-independent-patient`) in the toolbar of your own trial tab. Expected: a patient role and current revision, with no identity or proposal. Recovery: if creation or connection fails, resolve the launcher/connection message before entering data. Starting another session does not reconcile an earlier unknown write; do not use it to retry that write.

Actual offline screenshot with a separate numbered annotation, source `bdc4585`. Locator only: the pictured state is not proof that this step was newly executed.

## Step 3 — Check the private synthetic identity
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":3,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["private-entry-composite"],"control_ids":["private-disclosure","synthetic-phone","date-of-birth","zip-discriminator","check-identity"]} -->

Expand **2 · Private synthetic identity** (`private-disclosure`). Enter (1) **Synthetic phone** `555-0130` (`synthetic-phone`), (2) **Date of birth** `1978-09-22` (`date-of-birth`), and (3) **ZIP discriminator** `70115` (`zip-discriminator`). Select **Check or correct identity** (`check-identity`). Expected: Identity: verified and cleared browser input boxes; fixture matching is not production authentication. Blank boxes on later submissions preserve the service’s local draft, not new consent. Recovery: if missing or ambiguous, correct only the private controls and check again; do not request private results until verified.

Actual offline screenshot with a separate numbered annotation, source `bdc4585`. Locator only: the pictured state is not proof that this step was newly executed.

## Step 4 — Find current public providers
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":4,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["public-filters-composite"],"control_ids":["specialty","location","from-date","through-date","find-providers"]} -->

Choose (1) **Primary care** in Specialty (`specialty`) and (2) **Downtown** in Location (`location`); leave From date and Through date blank. Select **Find providers** (`find-providers`). Expected: the two returned public providers and matching Active filters, without private lookup or booking. Recovery: if no providers or an API error appears, review filters or use Help; do not fabricate a provider.

## Step 5 — Read and prepare the first ZIP's private state
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":5,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["returned-options-and-confirm-composite"],"control_ids":["lookup-appointments","get-availability","select-option"]} -->

Select **Look up my appointments** (`lookup-appointments`), then **Get current availability** (`get-availability`), then a current **Select option** (`select-option`). Expected: a proposal for the first verified ZIP; appointment lookup may be empty on a fresh mock. Do not confirm in this reader flow. Recovery: missing/failed reads require correction; do not manufacture results to demonstrate clearing.

## Step 6 — Correct only the ZIP discriminator
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":6,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["private-entry-composite"],"control_ids":["zip-discriminator","check-identity"]} -->

Enter `70005` in **ZIP discriminator** (`zip-discriminator`), leaving phone/DOB blank to retain their local draft; select **Check or correct identity** (`check-identity`). Expected: verified replacement fixture with old appointments, slots and proposal cleared before new reads. The old Confirm is unavailable. Recovery: if missing/ambiguous, check the exact private values; do not choose a candidate from a public list.

Actual offline screenshot with a separate numbered annotation, source `bdc4585`. Locator only: the pictured state is not proof that this step was newly executed.

## Step 7 — Look up the replacement fixture
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":7,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["returned-options-and-confirm-composite"],"control_ids":["lookup-appointments"]} -->

Select **Look up my appointments** (`lookup-appointments`). Expected: on fresh mock data, no existing appointments for the replacement fixture, rather than the first fixture's rows. Earlier completed/unknown history, if any, remains separate. Recovery: shared prior bookings may make the list nonempty; do not delete state to force a demonstration.

## Completion and cleanup

Effect: Private matching/lookup and an unconfirmed proposal only; no booking write or cancellation in these steps. No real staff or care is provided. An unknown write may have
succeeded: do not retry it, even after reset, reconnect or a new session.

Cleanup: stop only your own launch with Ctrl-C in its terminal. Do not stop another
listener, purge recordings, erase Operator state or reset accounting/effect history.
Leave any existing receipt/history and uncertainty protection intact.

## Known gaps and evidence

Recovery: After ZIP A→B, request fresh results and select a new proposal if continuing. The test includes an earlier booking to prove its receipt stays historical; this reader flow intentionally stops before booking.

From the repository root, the exact automated contract command is:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src:tests .venv/bin/python -m unittest -v test_transition_acceptance.TransitionAcceptanceTests.test_duplicate_zip_a_to_b_revokes_private_results_and_old_confirmation test_supplied_http.SuppliedHttpScenarioTests.test_multiple_patient_matches
```

These are existing test contracts, not a report of a run by this document worker.

Source basis: widget/service/core and test sources consulted at checker candidate
`66da0c8`; W2 actual offline atlas captures bind `bdc4585`. Later changes here
are documentation only and do not extend runtime evidence. The real HTTP transition method asserts empty replacement lookup, no stale confirmation effect and retained earlier history. W2 private/options images locate controls without capturing this A→B correction. The extra prior-booking branch is test-only here.

The atlas supplies actual app observations for its labeled state only. Its
acknowledgement/kernel/reconnect warnings remain gaps; synchronized screens are
not established by a visible role. This entire journey remains unverified on this
document revision. This worker did not launch BOB, run a browser, invoke a model,
capture new visuals, run the listed tests or repeat the parent’s combined suite.
Structural coverage is not browser certification. Parent final QA/integration is pending.
