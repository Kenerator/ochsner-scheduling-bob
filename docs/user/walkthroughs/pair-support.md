# Pair a patient with local demo Support

Purpose: Observe one patient's acknowledged public screen without transferring patient authority. Role: patient and local demo Support reviewer.

Scope: US5. Mode: offline control exercise; normal launch is model-first. Limits: synthetic local PoC only; no production authentication, live representative or clinical service. The full journey remains unverified on this documentation candidate.

## Step 0 — Install and set up

From the repository root, verify Python 3.11+ and install into the project environment:

```sh
python3.11 --version
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
.venv/bin/python -m pip check
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py --doctor
```

If `python3.11` is absent, use an explicit compatible executable, for example `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12`: verify its `--version` is 3.11+ and use that same executable for `-m venv .venv`. Do not assume `python3` is compatible. Follow [getting started](../getting-started.md) for the trusted exact-note helper and current application runtime policy. Doctor retrieves no key, starts no service and makes no model call.

## Step 1 — Launch

Normal model-first launch:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py
```

Open the printed local URL. Startup/readiness does not qualify model behavior. A port conflict is an error, not permission to stop another process. Ctrl-C owns only this launch and its children.

For an explicit no-call walkthrough, use the following only if **both ports are free**:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py --offline --ui-port 29580 --transport-port 29581
```

Do not reuse or stop an existing process on those ports. All supplied W2 capture evidence is offline or dated historical synthetic evidence; it is not genuine new model qualification.

## Arrange the workspace

Keep this rendered Markdown on the left and BOB on the right. In Chrome, open a tab's context menu and use **New split view**, then **Add tab** to select the other tab; use **Swap sides** if needed. See [official Chrome Split View guidance](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/16971124?hl=en). If unavailable, use side-by-side windows; no extension or experimental flags are needed.

## Synthetic sample data

1. Use two tabs at the same printed local URL.
2. Pairing grant: the newly generated one-use value; no fixed public sample exists.
3. Private synthetic phone: `555-0101` in **Synthetic phone** only.
4. Private DOB: `1985-04-12` in **Date of birth** only.
5. Private ZIP: `70112` in **ZIP discriminator** only. These values are optional orientation for flows that do not identify a patient.

Keep names, phone, DOB and ZIP out of the public request box. Only application-owned private identity controls receive those fixture values. Use only your own disposable local session and recording references.

## Step 2 — Start the patient and open the local support workspace
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":2,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["toolbar-composite"],"control_ids":["start-independent-patient"]} -->

Select **Start independent patient** (`start-independent-patient`) in a tab opened at the printed URL. Keep this patient tab open; open the same URL in a separate tab for Support. Expected: a new patient session, not reconnection to an old patient's effects. Recovery: if no patient state appears, check the launch connection and refresh; do not reset or reuse another person's session.

The figure is an existing atlas locator with separate numbered annotations over actual pixels; the action and expected result above are its text equivalent. It is not a newly executed result or a captured failure.

## Step 3 — Create and consume a one-use pairing grant
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":3,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["toolbar-composite"],"control_ids":["create-pairing","pairing-grant","join-support"]} -->

In the patient tab select **Create support pairing grant** (`create-pairing`). Transfer the displayed value privately into **One-use pairing grant** (`pairing-grant`) in the second tab and select **Join demo support** (`join-support`) once. Do not put grants in Markdown, public requests, screenshots or logs. Expected: the second tab changes to Support for this patient; joining does not take control. Recovery: an invalid, consumed or expired grant requires a new grant from the same current patient, not repeated use of the old value.

The figure is an existing atlas locator with separate numbered annotations over actual pixels; the action and expected result above are its text equivalent. It is not a newly executed result or a captured failure.

## Step 4 — Review joined membership and acknowledged freshness
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":4,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["support-joined-state-composite"],"control_ids":[]} -->

Read **Local participant**, **demo control**, lease, observation age and the last acknowledged patient revision. Expected contract: joined membership with inactive control and zero lease before takeover; Support sees acknowledged public state, not private phone/DOB/ZIP or a confirmation nonce. Current context and the last observed screen are separate. Recovery: if stale/missing or acknowledgement-unavailable is shown, return to the patient tab and review/refresh its current screen. Do not treat joined status as successful synchronization. This historical `e2dfa7e` composite is orientation to repaired membership labels only.

The figure is an existing atlas locator with separate numbered annotations over actual pixels; the action and expected result above are its text equivalent. It is not a newly executed result or a captured failure.

## Completion and cleanup

Effect: Local pairing, lease and public preference state only. No booking, mock handoff, real staff contact or care is performed. Replay and comparison confer no live consent or authority. If any earlier live write has unknown outcome, do not retry it; reconcile separately.

Cleanup: Close only your own demonstration tabs. If replay is playing, select Pause before leaving. Stop only your own launch with Ctrl-C; never stop an existing Operator process, purge an Operator recording, or erase capability, accounting or effect state.

## Known gaps and evidence

Recovery: Current IAB pairing was joined/inactive with acknowledgement-unavailable; fresh successful synchronization was not established. The historical joined figure is not evidence of a fresh run. If reconnect clears diagnostics or resets the replay index, inspect current state, reopen your owned reference if available and re-enter a valid bounded index. A queued action or click is not proof that the intended transition happened.

Source basis: application/atlas source `bdc4585` and parent checker checkpoint `66da0c8`, with later docs-only changes. Support originals retain `c3e6df2` / `e2dfa7e` where used: their unchanged control constructors are applicable, but the older membership label is not evidence of repaired status. Current IAB joined/inactive and acknowledgement-unavailable observations are not fresh successful synchronization.

The W2 atlas supplies historical/offline actual control observations only; this document adds no browser execution evidence. Test methods below describe existing automated contracts, not newly run tests:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src:tests .venv/bin/python -m unittest test_browser_service.BrowserServiceTests.test_pairing_requires_single_use_patient_grant -v
PYTHONPATH=src:tests .venv/bin/python -m unittest test_support_status.SupportStatusTests.test_paired_support_is_joined_before_taking_control -v
```

Not run by this document worker: setup/install/doctor, app launch, browser actions, fault injection, model calls, destructive purge, demos or the full suite. Parent owns combined verification and final integration. Structural coverage is not browser certification; no mobile, accessibility, renderer-parity or genuine new model qualification is claimed.
