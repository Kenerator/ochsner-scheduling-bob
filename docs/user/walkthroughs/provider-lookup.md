# Find public providers without private identity

Purpose: Inspect returned provider choices before any private scheduling step. Role: patient reviewer.
Scope: provider_lookup / US1 / FR-002. Mode: normal model-first launch with an explicit offline
control path; the documented local controls need no model call.
Limits: synthetic fixtures only; no production authentication, real staff contact
or clinical care. Discovery does not establish identity, clinical suitability, availability or a booking.

## Step 0 — Install and set up

From the repository root in your dedicated local checkout:

```sh
python3.11 --version
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
.venv/bin/python -m pip check
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py --doctor
```

Verify Python 3.11+ before creating the environment. If `python3.11` is absent,
use `python3.12 --version` and `python3.12 -m venv .venv` after verifying that
explicit executable is compatible; the remaining commands stay the same.
The doctor reads no key, starts no service and makes no model request. Use
[getting started](../getting-started.md) for the trusted exact-note helper and
current application runtime policy; do not paste a key into BOB or these notes.
Resolve a failed install, dependency check or doctor before proceeding.

## Step 1 — Launch

Normal model-first launch:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py
```

Open the printed local URL. Startup/readiness is not model qualification.
For an explicit no-call walkthrough alternative, use the following ONLY IF both
ports are free:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/poc-runtime/launch.py --offline --ui-port 29580 --transport-port 29581
```

A port conflict is not permission to stop another process. Do not reuse an
existing process for this trial; arrange another free pair or defer launch.
Ctrl-C in your launch terminal stops only this launch's owned children. All
supplied W2 capture evidence is offline or explicitly historical, with no new
genuine model qualification.

## Arrange the workspace

Keep this rendered Markdown on the left and BOB on the right. In Chrome, open
the tab context menu and choose **New split view**, then **Add tab** for the
other page; use **Swap sides** if needed. Follow the
[official Chrome Split View instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/16971124?hl=en).
If unavailable, arrange two windows side by side; no extension or experimental
flags are required. Open figures full size if labels are small; each action
below also has a text equivalent.

## Synthetic sample data

1. Public Specialty: Primary care (`primary_care`).
2. Public Location: Downtown (`downtown`).
3. From date and Through date: blank; private controls remain unused.

Identity values belong only in private controls. Keep names, phone, DOB and ZIP
out of Public scheduling request; its examples below contain public intent only.

## Step 2 — Start a dedicated patient session
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":2,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["toolbar-composite"],"control_ids":["start-independent-patient"]} -->

Select **Start independent patient** (`start-independent-patient`) in the toolbar of your own trial tab. Expected: a patient role and current revision, with no identity or proposal. Recovery: if creation or connection fails, resolve the launcher/connection message before entering data. Starting another session does not reconcile an earlier unknown write; do not use it to retry that write.

Actual offline screenshot with a separate numbered annotation, source `bdc4585`. Locator only: the pictured state is not proof that this step was newly executed.

## Step 3 — Find current public providers
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":3,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["public-filters-composite"],"control_ids":["specialty","location","from-date","through-date","find-providers"]} -->

Choose (1) **Primary care** in Specialty (`specialty`) and (2) **Downtown** in Location (`location`); leave From date and Through date blank. Select **Find providers** (`find-providers`). Expected: the two returned public providers and matching Active filters, without private lookup or booking. Recovery: if no providers or an API error appears, review filters or use Help; do not fabricate a provider.

## Step 4 — Choose a public provider filter
<!-- walkthrough-step: {"number":4,"interactive":true,"visual_ids":["public-request-and-provider-composite"],"control_ids":["choose-provider"]} -->

Review the returned list, then select **Choose provider 2** (`choose-provider`). Expected: the provider filter names the returned provider; no private appointment rows, slots or booking outcome are created. Recovery: a missing/outdated choice requires Find providers again, not an invented provider number.

## Completion and cleanup

Effect: Public provider read and local filter selection only; no private read or mock booking/handoff write. No real staff or care is provided. An unknown write may have
succeeded: do not retry it, even after reset, reconnect or a new session.

Cleanup: stop only your own launch with Ctrl-C in its terminal. Do not stop another
listener, purge recordings, erase Operator state or reset accounting/effect history.
Leave any existing receipt/history and uncertainty protection intact.

## Known gaps and evidence

Recovery: Refine public filters or use Help after a failed read. Availability and appointment lookup require a separately verified identity; discovery success does not authorize either.

From the repository root, the exact automated contract command is:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src:tests .venv/bin/python -m unittest -v test_supplied_http.SuppliedHttpScenarioTests.test_provider_lookup test_conversation.ConversationTests.test_offline_public_lookup_needs_no_identity_or_model test_conversation.ConversationTests.test_provider_selection_correction_and_clear_preserve_other_filters
```

These are existing test contracts, not a report of a run by this document worker.

Source basis: widget/service/core and test sources consulted at checker candidate
`66da0c8`; W2 actual offline atlas captures bind `bdc4585`. Later changes here
are documentation only and do not extend runtime evidence. W2 public discovery actually displayed two providers without identity at bdc4585. The methods assert public-only HTTP and returned-provider filtering; no new whole-journey browser execution is claimed.

The atlas supplies actual app observations for its labeled state only. Its
acknowledgement/kernel/reconnect warnings remain gaps; synchronized screens are
not established by a visible role. This entire journey remains unverified on this
document revision. This worker did not launch BOB, run a browser, invoke a model,
capture new visuals, run the listed tests or repeat the parent’s combined suite.
Structural coverage is not browser certification. Parent final QA/integration is pending.

## Revision history

- 2026-10-14: Drafted from exact native, test, widget/service and source-bound atlas
  sources; parent final QA/integration pending.
